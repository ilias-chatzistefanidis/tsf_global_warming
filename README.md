## Time Series Forecasting on Global Warming

Time-Series Forecasting on a dataset of temperature measurements using a variety of Machine Learning models, to predict future temperatures and evaluate how accurate each model is. We use a wide range of methods, from Linear Regression and SVMs to LSTM, SARIMA, XGBoost and AutoML.
